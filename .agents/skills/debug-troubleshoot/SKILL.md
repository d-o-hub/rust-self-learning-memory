# Debug and Troubleshoot

Systematic debugging approach for Rust async code with Tokio, Turso, and redb.

## Quick Reference

- **[Logging](logging.md)** - Tracing and log configuration
- **[Tokio Console](tokio-console.md)** - Async task debugging
- **[Common Issues](issues.md)** - Common problems and fixes
- **[Techniques](techniques.md)** - Debugging techniques

## When to Use

- Diagnosing runtime issues
- Performance problems
- Async deadlocks
- Database connection issues
- Panics and crashes

## Debugging Tools

1. **Logging** - tracing with RUST_LOG levels
2. **Tokio Console** - Async task inspection
3. **Backtraces** - Panic analysis
4. **Metrics** - Performance profiling

See **[logging.md](logging.md)** for tracing setup and **[issues.md](issues.md)** for common problems.
