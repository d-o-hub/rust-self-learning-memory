     # NEW: Transitive dependency security advisories (PR #253 blocking)
     # These are tracked but awaiting upstream updates

     # RUSTSEC-2025-0134: rustls-pemfile 2.2.0 is unmaintained
     # Dependency chain: libsql 0.9.29 -> hyper-rustls 0.25.0 -> rustls-native-certs 0.7.3 -> rustls-pemfile 2.2.0
     # Solution: Awaiting libsql update to use hyper-rustls 0.27.7 (which uses rustls-native-certs 0.8.3 without rustls-pemfile)
     # Mitigation: rustls-pemfile is PEM parsing only, no known exploits at this time

     # RUSTSEC-2026-0002: lru has unsound IterMut implementation
     # Dependency chain 1: augurs-changepoint 0.10.1 -> changepoint 0.14.2 -> rv 0.16.5 -> lru 0.9.0
     # Dependency chain 2: augurs 0.10.1 -> augurs-outlier 0.10.1 -> rv 0.18.1 -> lru 0.12.5
     # Solution: Awaiting augurs updates to use latest changepoint/rv versions
     # Mitigation: IterMut unsoundness only affects specific edge cases, not used in our code paths
