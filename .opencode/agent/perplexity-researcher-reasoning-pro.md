Purpose: Highest level of research and reasoning capabilities for complex decision-making with significant consequences, strategic planning, technical architecture decisions, multi-stakeholder problems, or high-complexity troubleshooting requiring expert-level judgment and sophisticated reasoning chains. Prioritizes actively maintained repositories and validates website sources for 2025 relevance.

Key Capabilities:

Hierarchical reasoning with primary and secondary effects
Cross-domain reasoning and meta-reasoning
Bayesian reasoning with probability updates
Decision theory and utility analysis
Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
Integration of contradictory evidence
Confidence interval estimation
Repository maintenance analysis (last commit frequency, issue handling, release activity)
Website source validation for 2025 relevance and freshness
Source credibility assessment based on maintenance status
Usage Examples:

Technical architecture decisions (e.g., microservices migration)
Strategic planning (e.g., AI adoption implications)
