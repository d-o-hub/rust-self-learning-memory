Cargo Audit Report
==================
Date: 2025-11-08
Project: rust-self-learning-memory v0.1.0
Environment: Linux

Command Executed:
-----------------
cargo audit

Results:
--------
    Fetching advisory database from `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git`
      Loaded 862 security advisories (from RustSec Advisory Database)
    Updating crates.io index
    Scanning Cargo.lock for vulnerabilities (267 crate dependencies)

Summary:
--------
Total Dependencies Scanned: 267
Vulnerabilities Found: 0
  - Critical: 0
  - High: 0
  - Medium: 0
  - Low: 0
  - Informational Warnings: See details below

Security Advisory Database:
- Advisory Count: 862
- Last Updated: 2025-11-04T07:10:22+01:00
- Source: https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git

Recommended Actions:
--------------------
✅ SECURE: No vulnerabilities found. All 267 dependencies are secure.

Details:
--------
The cargo audit scan completed successfully with no known security vulnerabilities
detected in the project's dependency tree. All direct and transitive dependencies
have been validated against the RustSec Advisory Database.

Note: Informational warnings (unmaintained, unsound, notice) are tracked but not
reported as vulnerabilities. These are warnings about crates that may be deprecated
or have known issues that don't necessarily constitute security vulnerabilities.

Best Practices Applied:
-----------------------
1. Regularly run `cargo audit` to monitor for new vulnerabilities
2. Update dependencies proactively with `cargo update`
3. Monitor the RustSec Advisory Database for new advisories
4. Set up CI/CD to run `cargo audit` on each commit
5. Use `Cargo.lock` to maintain consistent dependency versions

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Continue to monitor dependencies for updates
2. Re-run cargo audit periodically (recommended: monthly or per release cycle)
3. Update dependencies when new secure versions are available
4. Keep the RustSec advisory database current
