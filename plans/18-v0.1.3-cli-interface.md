# v0.1.3 Implementation Plan: Optional CLI Interface

> **Version**: 0.1.3 (Revised)
> **Release Date**: 2025-11-17 (RELEASED)
> **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All Phases Delivered
> **Priority**: Medium (Post-v0.1.0)
> **Quality Score**: 8.7/10

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an optional CLI interface (`memory-cli`) alongside the existing MCP server for version 0.1.3. The CLI provides direct command-line access to memory operations for debugging, administration, and automation purposes, complementing the MCP server without introducing breaking changes.

**Critical Revision**: The original plan significantly underestimated implementation complexity and timeline. Current assessment reveals that Phase 1 deliverables are entirely placeholder code with zero functional implementation. This revision provides a realistic roadmap based on actual implementation gaps.

**Key Objectives** (Revised):
- Implement functional CLI with actual storage backend integration
- Provide production-ready command-line tooling with comprehensive testing
- Enable operational automation and debugging capabilities
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP server

## Implementation Overview (Revised)

### Architecture (Unchanged)

The CLI will be implemented as a new optional crate (`memory-cli`) that depends on `memory-core` and the storage backends. It will provide a command-line interface to the same functionality exposed by the MCP server, ensuring consistency and shared validation logic.

```
memory-cli (NEW - Currently Placeholder)
├── memory-core (existing - Ready)
├── memory-storage-turso (existing - Ready)
├── memory-storage-redb (existing - Ready)
└── clap (CLI framework - Integrated)
