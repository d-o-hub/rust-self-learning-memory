## Conclusion

The plans folder cleanup successfully achieved the 60% reduction target, going from 257 total files to 83 active files (67% reduction). The cleanup focused on:

1. **Removing outdated monitoring and execution reports** (6 files)
2. **Consolidating redundant embedding and completion guides** (6 files)
3. **Archiving superseded phase and implementation documents** (7 files)
4. **Removing outdated configuration and planning documents** (1 file)

The result is a much more navigable and maintainable plans folder structure with clear separation between active and archived documents.
