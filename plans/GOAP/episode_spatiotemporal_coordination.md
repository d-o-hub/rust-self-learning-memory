# Episode: Spatiotemporal Index Integration Completion Coordination

## Episode Context

**Episode ID**: EP-2026-01-01-spatiotemporal-coord
**Start Time**: 2026-01-01
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

### Task Context
- **Language**: coordination
- **Domain**: goap
- **Task Type**: coordination
- **Tags**:
  - spatiotemporal-integration
  - multi-agent
  - deployment-decision

### Episode Description

Coordination of multi-agent effort to complete spatiotemporal index integration and make deployment decision for the memory management system. This episode will track:
- Agent coordination across development, testing, and review
- Decision-making process for deployment readiness
- Integration of spatiotemporal indexing capabilities
- Quality gate validation and final approval

### Objective

Coordinate completion of spatiotemporal index feature through intelligent agent orchestration, ensuring:
1. All implementation work is complete and integrated
2. Comprehensive testing validates functionality
3. Code quality standards are met
4. Deployment decision is informed by thorough validation

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All implementation tasks completed
- [ ] Test suite passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Code review approval obtained
- [ ] Quality gates validated
- [ ] Deployment decision made and documented
- [ ] Episode patterns extracted for future learning

### Coordination Strategy

**Planned Execution Mode**: Hybrid (Sequential phases with parallel validation)

### Phase Breakdown (Initial Plan)

#### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
- Analyze current state of spatiotemporal index implementation
- Identify remaining tasks and dependencies
- Create detailed coordination plan

#### Phase 2: Implementation Completion
- Coordinate feature-implementer for remaining code
- Integrate changes across relevant crates

#### Phase 3: Validation (Parallel)
- test-runner: Execute comprehensive test suite
- code-reviewer: Quality audit and standards compliance
- debugger: Performance validation

#### Phase 4: Decision & Documentation
- Aggregate validation results
- Make deployment decision
- Document outcomes and lessons learned

### Agent Coordination

**Primary Agents**:
- GOAP (this agent): Overall orchestration and coordination
- feature-implementer: Implementation completion
- test-runner: Testing and validation
- code-reviewer: Quality review
- debugger: Performance analysis

### Risk Assessment

**High Priority Risks**:
- Integration conflicts with existing storage backends
- Performance regressions from new indexing
- Quality gate failures requiring rework

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Parallel validation to catch issues early
- Incremental integration with rollback capability
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking
