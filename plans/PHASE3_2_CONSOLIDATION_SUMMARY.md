## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Strategic Consolidation**
   - Grouping related implementation summaries together
   - Maintaining chronological order within consolidations
   - Preserving all details while reducing file count

2. **Organized Archival**
   - Creating dated subfolders for clear organization
   - Comprehensive index updates for discoverability
   - Descriptive file listings in archive index

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Clear table of contents in consolidated documents
   - Section headers matching original file names
   - Maintenance notes for future updates

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Earlier Consolidation**
   - Could have consolidated as phases completed
   - Would prevent accumulation of similar documents
   - Recommend consolidating after each major phase

2. **Cross-Reference Management**
   - Need systematic approach to updating references
   - Consider using relative paths consistently
   - Automate link checking if possible

3. **Permission Handling**
   - Some files had restrictive permissions
   - Need consistent file permission policy
   - Ensure all documentation is readable
