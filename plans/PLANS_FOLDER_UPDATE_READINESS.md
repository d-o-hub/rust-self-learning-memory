---

## Post-Research Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Review Research Findings (30 min)
- Analyze MCP protocol version comparison
- Review OAuth 2.1 support findings
- Examine MCP Inspector CI/CD requirements
- Study performance benchmarking approaches

### Phase 2: Decision Matrix (15 min)
For each research topic, determine:
- Create new research document?
- Create new execution plan?
- Update existing plan?
- Archive outdated plan?

### Phase 3: Create/Update Plans (1-2 hours)
- Create research documentation (up to 4 files)
- Create execution plans (up to 4 files)
- Update existing plans (2-3 files)
- All files ≤500 lines

### Phase 4: Update Indices (30 min)
- Update `RESEARCH_INDEX.md` with new research
- Update `ROADMAP.md` (after splitting first)
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (after splitting first)
- Update navigation files

### Phase 5: Archive Cleanup (15 min)
- Move completed/obsolete plans to archive
- Update `ARCHIVE_INDEX.md`
- Document archival decisions

### Phase 6: Compliance Validation (30 min)
- Verify all files ≤500 lines
- Check naming conventions
- Validate cross-references
- Update README files

**Total Estimated Time**: 2.5 - 4 hours

## Priority Actions (In Order)

### 1. Split Large Files (Must Do First)
- [ ] Split ROADMAP.md into multiple focused documents
- [ ] Split IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md into multiple focused documents
- **Why**: Compliance requirement before creating new plans

### 2. Create Research Documentation
- [ ] MCP protocol version research findings
- [ ] OAuth 2.1 research findings
- [ ] MCP Inspector CI/CD research findings
- [ ] Performance benchmarking research findings
- **Why**: Document research results for future reference

### 3. Create Execution Plans (As Needed)
- [ ] MCP protocol upgrade plan (if applicable)
- [ ] OAuth 2.1 implementation plan
- [ ] MCP Inspector integration plan
- [ ] Performance benchmarking implementation plan
- **Why**: Turn research findings into actionable plans

### 4. Update Existing Plans
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md with new priorities
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with new tasks
- [ ] Update RESEARCH_INDEX.md
- **Why**: Keep planning documents current

### 5. Archive Cleanup
- [ ] Archive outdated plans
- [ ] Update archive indices
- **Why**: Maintain clean, organized plans folder
