## Standing product decisions (do not reopen casually)

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Agent code execution | **Fail-closed**; S1.1c Wasmtime/WASI **NO-GO** |
| Batch MCP tools | Explicitly deferred |
| Release creation | Automated only: `release-manager.sh ship` → tag → `release.yml` |
| Serialization | Postcard required |
| ADR-075 durable complete | All-or-nothing; backend failures are hard errors |
| ADR-076 pattern list | Empty diagnostics in human mode; JSON/YAML machine-stable |
