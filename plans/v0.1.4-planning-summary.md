## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Strict scope control, defer non-critical to v0.2.0 |
| Breaking changes during cleanup | Medium | Low | Comprehensive tests, careful review |
| Documentation effort underestimated | Low | Medium | Start early, iterate |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Continuous benchmarking |
