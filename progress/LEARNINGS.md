## 2026-04-17 — SQL Injection in Metadata Queries
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input was interpolated into SQL using `format!` in `query_episodes_by_metadata`.
**Learning:** Even specialized functions like `json_extract` support parameterized paths in `libsql`/SQLite.
**Prevention:** Avoid `format!` for any SQL string construction; always prefer `libsql::params!`.
